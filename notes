How will this work?
Good question. I'll try to answer it as I go along during my work through this

------------- first log ------------------

Firstly, I'll try to make it a SPA. To do that I'll have a single page. What I'm thinking now is that there'll be one controller
(dashboard_controller) which will take care of all the other controllers and their respective partials.

-------------- second log ----------------

The dashboard_controller now displays only an #index page. That page has some javascirpt which is called on document.ready and kicks off
a request to /api/home (Articles#home) which then returns all the articles. Right now there are no articles. My current idea of an architecture
for this is as follows:

AJAX request for all Articles --> Articles#home tells all configured API accessors to get data --> API accessors get data and clean it into articles --> Articles#home conglomerates all data and gives it to Dashboard#index

I can simplify this and just ask Articles#home to ask Articles#<source> to get the data, but I need some API key. I already added 'authentication.yml'
to my gitignore so I need to figure out how to load YAML files. It would be good if I could create a rake task for this.

- create rake task to read authentication.yml
- put something in authentication.yml
- access API from Articles#<source>

after speaking to Jeremy he suggested that I use the 'services' as a way to call an external API. These services should inherit from a base
InternalRequestService class, just like we do in PM
