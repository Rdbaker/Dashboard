My Dashboard
============

##This whole project
Started with a question:
"Where do you find the libraries and frameworks that you eventually decide to use in your projects?" I asked my mentor.

He told me he keeps up with the community: blog posts, forums, and twitter feeds are just a few of the ways he
learns about new technologies to use.

I decided that I could aggregate all my sources of news and make it a one-stop-shop for me!

##This is my home, my resting spot, my base of operations
I decided to gather news from a few sources:

* NPR (done)
* Reddit (done)
* Twitter
* various blogs (more details later)

Eventually I can expand this to cover more than just tech news. I can do world news and landscapes and good music.
Anything I want I'll be able to find here.

A few technical details:

* rails
* backbonejs
* bootstrap
* coffeescript
* jquery
* (more to come, I'm sure)
